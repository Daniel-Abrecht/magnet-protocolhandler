# magnet-protocolhandler

A protocol handler for magnet urls using the protocolloadfallbackhandler & webtorrent projects:
 * https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent
 * https://github.com/Daniel-Abrecht/protocolloadfallbackhandler

This allows the usage of magnet URIs like any other URL. It's already usable but still incomplete.
